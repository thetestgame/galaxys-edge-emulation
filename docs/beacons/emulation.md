# Emulating Beacons	

There are many ways to emulate bluetooth beacons. One of the more accessible ways is to use a bluetooth enabled phone and an app.						
I have found nRF Connect for Android devices works well. This video by VProFX demonstrates using nRF Connect

There is an iOS version of nRF Connect, however it does not allow for simulating beacons.						
You could also use dedicated hardware, such as a BBC Micro:bit as demonstrated by the Burbank Makerspace in this YouTube video:
