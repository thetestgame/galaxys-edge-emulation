# Discovery

Seeing how the codes resemble QR codes (but aren't), I was able to scan them directly with a universal scanner app. (Woo, Scandit!) I discovered they're Aztec codes, and that there's not much else special about them. Like QR codes, they represent text, but with Aztec codes you generally have a smaller code size and they're less picky about how much room you give them. Interestingly, the Wikipedia page on them states that they are good for displaying on mobile devices such as phones, making it trivial to snap a picture of one and scan it in later.

# Extrapolation

Scanning some of these Aztec codes in the Smuggler's Run ride gave me an interesting pattern. All of them were composed of the letters "FAL" and a two digit number. I found a tool [Tec-It Aztec Gen](https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/Aztec) that could generate Aztec codes online from a phone so I could do some testing. With that, I discovered all codes from FAL01 to FAL30 are valid cargo tags.

Outside the ride, the pattern was a little less obvious. The codes were not physically grouped together in any particular way, but there is a pattern to the underlying text in the codes. Similarly to the "FAL" codes, these start with two uppercase alphabetically consecutive letters like AB, BC, CD all the way down to JK. Next is an underscore, and after that two more alphabetically consecutive letters from LM to UV. I tried every combination of these, and together with the "FAL" series, that gave me 97 working codes that give out various items and collectibles.

I don't know if some of the ones that didn't work for me only work in SWGE west, or they were just not deployed when I was there, but this is what I have so far.
